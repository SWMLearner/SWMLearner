# 👋 Hi, I'm Sargam Wadhwa

**ML Engineer | From Storytelling (Sports/PR) to Building Data Stories with Code**

I am a former writer (sports journalist & PR ghostwriter) who transitioned into machine learning, reconnecting with my foundational degree in Statistics. I now combine **statistical rigor** with modern **ML engineering** to build, explain, and deploy end-to-end data solutions. My goal is to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights and robust applications.

I am actively exploring Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist opportunities, with a particular interest in roles within **Southeast Asia, PRC, or global companies operating in these regions**.

## 📂 Project Portfolio

### 🚀 **Flagship Project: End-to-End ML System**
**[9-Way Hybrid Recommender System](https://github.com/SWMLearner/9-way-recommender-system)**
A production-grade course recommendation engine. Implements 8 collaborative/content-based algorithms, **containerized with Docker**, and deployed via **automated CI/CD** to Streamlit Cloud and ModelScope. Demonstrates full-stack ML engineering.
*`Python` `Docker` `Streamlit` `CI/CD` `Scikit-learn`*

### ⚙️ **MLOps & Deployment Focus**
**[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/SWMLearner/credit-card-fraud-detection)**
Built a classifier for highly imbalanced transaction data (0.17% fraud). Focused on model evaluation, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and comparing multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
*`Python` `XGBoost` `Imbalanced-Learn` `Scikit-learn` `Jupyter`*

### 🧠 **Deep Learning & Unsupervised Learning**
**[Deep Learning Fashion Classifier](https://github.com/SWMLearner/deep-learning-fashion-classifier)**
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, building foundational computer vision skills.
*`Python` `TensorFlow` `Keras` `CNN`*

**[Market Segmentation with Clustering](https://github.com/SWMLearner/market-segmentation-unsupervised-ml)**
Segmented 16,500+ video games using K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering. Translated results into business intelligence ("Global Blockbusters," "Japan-Focused Titles").
*`Python` `Scikit-learn` `Clustering` `PCA` `EDA`*

## 📈 Supervised Learning & Regression
**[Football Goal Analysis](https://github.com/SWMLearner/football-goal-analysis)**
A project from the IBM Machine Learning Certificate applying **supervised learning**. Developed and evaluated regression models to analyze and predict factors influencing goal-scoring events in football, moving from exploration to statistical modeling.
*`Python` `Pandas` `Scikit-learn` `Regression` `Statistical Modeling`*

### 📊 **Exploratory Data & Analysis**
**[Football Data EDA](https://github.com/SWMLearner/football_eda)**
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis of European football data, uncovering trends in player performance and team finance.
*`Python` `Pandas` `Seaborn` `EDA`*


## 📜 Education & Certification
*   **B.Sc. in Statistics** - My formal foundation in data analysis, statistical inference, and mathematical modeling.
*   **IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate** (Coursera) - A six-course specialization covering data science, supervised/unsupervised learning, and a capstone project.

## ✍️ My Unique Edge
My background in **sports journalism and PR ghostwriting** is not a detour; it's a core strength. It means I am adept at:
*   **Explaining complex technical concepts** clearly to any audience.
*   **Articulating the business value** of a model, not just its accuracy.
*   **Documenting and presenting** work effectively.

I bridge the gap between statistical theory, machine learning implementation, and clear communication.
