# 👋 Hi, I'm Sargam Wadhwa

**ML Engineer | From Storytelling (Sports/PR) to Building Data Stories with Code**

I am a former writer (sports journalist & PR ghostwriter) who transitioned into machine learning, reconnecting with my foundational degree in Statistics. I now combine **statistical rigor** with modern **ML engineering** to build, explain, and deploy end-to-end data solutions. My goal is to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights and robust applications.

I am actively exploring Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist opportunities, with a particular interest in roles within **Southeast Asia, PRC, or global companies operating in these regions**.

## 📂 Project Portfolio

### 🚀 **Flagship Project: End-to-End ML System**
**[9-Way Hybrid Recommender System](https://github.com/SWMLearner/9-way-recommender-system)**
A production-grade course recommendation engine. Implements 8 collaborative/content-based algorithms, **containerized with Docker** via automated CI/CD. 


**Dual-platform deployed:** hosted on **[Streamlit Cloud](https://9-way-recommender-system.streamlit.app/)** for global access and **[ModelScope](https://modelscope.ai/studios/SargamWadhwa/9-way-recommender-system)** for the Chinese developer ecosystem. Demonstrates full-stack ML engineering and practical, market-aware deployment.
*`Python` `Docker` `Streamlit` `CI/CD` `Scikit-learn` `ModelScope`*

### ⚙️ **MLOps & Deployment Focus**
**[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/SWMLearner/credit-card-fraud-detection)**
Built a classifier for highly imbalanced transaction data (0.17% fraud). Focused on model evaluation, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and comparing multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
*`Python` `XGBoost` `Imbalanced-Learn` `Scikit-learn` `Jupyter`*

### 🧠 **Deep Learning & Unsupervised Learning**
**[Deep Learning Fashion Classifier](https://github.com/SWMLearner/deep-learning-fashion-classifier)**
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, building foundational computer vision skills.
*`Python` `TensorFlow` `Keras` `CNN`*

**[Market Segmentation with Clustering](https://github.com/SWMLearner/market-segmentation-unsupervised-ml)**
Segmented 16,500+ video games using K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering. Translated results into business intelligence ("Global Blockbusters," "Japan-Focused Titles").
*`Python` `Scikit-learn` `Clustering` `PCA` `EDA`*

## 📈 Supervised Learning & Regression
**[Football Goal Analysis](https://github.com/SWMLearner/football-goal-analysis)**
A project from the IBM Machine Learning Certificate applying **supervised learning**. Developed and evaluated regression models to analyze and predict factors influencing goal-scoring events in football, moving from exploration to statistical modeling.
*`Python` `Pandas` `Scikit-learn` `Regression` `Statistical Modeling`*

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
**[Football Data EDA](https://github.com/SWMLearner/football_eda)**
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis of European football data. Applied statistical reasoning and hypothesis testing to validate insights about player valuations, team performance, and financial efficiency.
*`Python` `Pandas` `Seaborn` `EDA`*


## 📜 Education & Certification

*   **B.Sc. in Statistics** - My formal foundation in data analysis and statistical inference. While the university curriculum of the time felt disconnected from practical application, it planted the core theoretical seeds. **Re-engaging with these concepts through modern Python and Machine Learning has been a revelation—transforming rigid theory into a dynamic, problem-solving toolkit.**
*   **IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate** (Coursera) - The catalyst for this transition. This six-course specialization equipped me with the practical skills to build, evaluate, and deploy models, effectively bridging the gap between my statistical foundation and contemporary data science.

## ✍️ My Unique Edge

My career has been a deliberate search for rigorous, impactful problem-solving.

My background in **sports journalism and PR ghostwriting** honed my ability to **explain complex concepts clearly** and **translate technical details into strategic value** for any audience. However, I consistently sought a deeper, more analytical challenge.

This drive led me to **re-engage with my foundational Statistics degree through the lens of modern Machine Learning**. For me, ML engineering is the ideal synthesis: it demands **statistical rigor**, **creative solution design**, and **production-focused building**. It finally provides the sustained mental stimulation I was seeking.

I bridge the gap between theory and practice, building robust systems and clearly articulating their business impact.
