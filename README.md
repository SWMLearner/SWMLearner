### 📜 Background & Journey
My career is a calculated pivot to machine learning, built on a solid academic foundation:
- **🎓 B.Sc. (Hons) Statistics** from Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi (2010-2013).  
- **💡 The Spark:** Discovered that machine learning is "statistics spoken through Python"—efficient, powerful, and intellectually rewarding.  
- **🚀 The Transition:** Completed IBM's Machine Learning Professional Certificate and built a portfolio of deployed projects to bridge theory with production-grade practice.  
- **✍️ Unique Edge:** My background in **sports journalism and writing** equips me with a crucial, often rare skill in tech: the ability to communicate complex results clearly and persuasively to any audience.
